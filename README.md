## Purpose of the application
Valkyrie is a community developed scenario builder for the board games Descent Second Edition and Mansions of Madness Second Edition.

- The app can be used to create and play user generated scenarios.
- The app requires to import data from the official Fantasy Flight games Descent Road to Legend or Mansions of Madness apps for Android or Steam or alternatively import data from a zip file.
- Custom scenarios are hosted on GitHub and then downloaded to the user device as a container file.
- Content creators can create scenarios that contain custom content such as new tiles and characters that are not included as default content in Valkyrie. These content packs can be created for Descent 2nd Edition and Mansions of Madness 2nd Edition. Those content packs can later be published on GitHub to be available in Valkyrie automatically. Using this method Valkyrie can be expanded with other games as well as long as they are based on similar systems as Descent 2nd Edition and Mansions of Madness (e.g. a DOOM: The Board Game mod is already available as custom content pack).
