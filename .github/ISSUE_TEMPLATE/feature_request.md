<!--
  Thank you for proposing a new feature! To streamline our all efforts, please
  first read this short paragraph. If you can check all the boxes below, go for
  it and propose the feature!

  - [ ] I will update AddFeatureShortDescriptionHere in the issue title to contain a useful short description for the feature (this makes the list look much cleaner ;)
  - [ ] I have searched the documentation to make sure I did not overlook it.
  - [ ] Valkyrie's current features cannot be used to approximate this behaviour.
  - [ ] I have searched all issues (open and closed) to see if someone else
        wants something similar to which I could propose modifications (two
        features in one are easier and faster for us to implement).
