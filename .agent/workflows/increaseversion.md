description: Increase the app version of Valkyrie
---

Increase version numbers in files:
- unity\Assets\Resources\version.txt
- unity\Assets\Resources\prod_version.txt

1. Ensure to keep numbers for both files in sync.
2. If specified "major" then increase major version number e.g. from 3.14 to 4.14. Otherwise if not specified always increase minor version.
